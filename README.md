Machine learning project based on the Kaggle "Apartment rental offers in Germany" dataset for the Data Talks Club Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2023.

# Problem Description
The real estate market in Germany is dynamic and influenced by various factors such as location, property type, size, amenities, and economic conditions. Accurately predicting rental prices is crucial for both property owners and potential tenants to make informed decisions. In this context, developing a reliable machine learning model to predict housing rent prices in Germany becomes paramount.

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the monthly rent for residential properties in Germany based on selected features.
